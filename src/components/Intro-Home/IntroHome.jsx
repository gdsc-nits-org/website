              Today&apos;s user&apos;s query is if they like the interface of the product

              interface? UI/UX designers are responsible to answer the queries who are
              committed to improving the user experience. While UI focuses on the visual
              components, interaction elements, colour schemes, typography, photographs,
              and other aspects that come together to provide an appealing visual
              description. To promote user-friendliness and ease of use.UX design, on the
              other hand, concentrates on the emotions of the user as they engage with the
              components, starting from landing till the end action of the user. The GDGC
              Nit Silchar looks forward to exposing new aspirants to the UI/UX area and
              training them to develop revolutionary innovation and creativity to satisfy
              the expectations of the expanding design-centric business. Prototype Planary
              Workshops are yearly held by GDGC NITS to get people started on UI/UX
              designing and construct projects for practical learning.

              the developers can churn out features one after the another with incredible
              velocity without worrying about the conventional problems that arise in
              teams of a considerable size. DevOps is something that no software
